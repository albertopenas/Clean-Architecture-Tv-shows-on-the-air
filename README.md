# Clean-Architecture-Tv-shows-on-the-air

Clean architecture implementation based on SOLID principles.

The idea is to create a Mobile app that makes an API call to get tv shows on the air.
For that purpose we will use the moviedb API, [get more info in the moviedb](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#reference/tv/tvontheair/get)

Learning objetives
- use tdd.
- testing pipeline.

Choose the platform do yo want but remember that you can use some dependency inyection or parttern to respect DIP principle.
